Description: The package generates pseudo-absence points (PAP) to be used in species distribution modeling (SDM) and environmental niche modeling (ENM). The process involves taking an environmental space represented by a set of points P and a set of presence points (PP) as input and then generating points that mimic environmental conditions of a true absence.  The resulting PPA is a subset of P and does not contain any points in common with PP,  meaning that PP and PPA are disjoint sets. The package provides several different methods of PPA generation.

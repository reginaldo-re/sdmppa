Description: Most algorithms used in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) require both presences and absences, but true absences are often not available. In such cases, the package generates pseudo-absence points (PAP) for use in SDM and environmental niche modeling (ENM). This process involves taking an environmental space represented by a set of points (P) and a set of presence points (PP) as input, and then generating points that replicate the environmental conditions of a true absence. The resulting PPA is a subset of P and does not contain any points in common with PP, meaning that PP and PPA are disjoint sets. The package offers various methods for generating PPA.
